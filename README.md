# ICS4U CPT: Data Interaction and Visualization - Stephanie Tam

This data represents the deaths caused by top 3 vaccine-preventable diseases in all countries across the world in years 2010 to 2018. The data aims to show the trend of vaccines greatly reducing the prevalence of diseases as society and technology advances. This data modeling and visualization explains vaccines’ impact on global health, and how the world can make more progress against early death and disease with the help of vaccines.

I selected this dataset because the topic of vaccination is very relevant–especially during a pandemic. Along with my interest in health/medical fields, my first exposure to this topic was a TB skin test as a preparation for hospital co-op. When researching, I was shocked to learn that Tuberculosis is the leading disease for deaths. By displaying graphs, I hope to provide insight for people (especially anti-vaxxers) to realize the importance of vaccinations. The graphs allow viewers to see the impact of first-world countries with access to vaccinations, compared to countries where vaccination coverage is low, resulting in higher numbers of deaths.
